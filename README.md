## 5] Challenges and Solutions

- THIS IS A SAMPLE "CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS" BLOCK:

- The Bookshelf Project was designed to offer a smooth experience across Architecture, Networking, and User Interaction Layers...
- However, like many modern Mobile Apps, it encountered several challenges during development:

### a] Glide URL Failure and Image Loading Issues

**Challenge:**
Glide failed to load Book Thumbnails due to malformed Image URLs (e.g. `httpss://...`) and Dimension Warnings such as `[536x-2147483648]`...

**Solution:**
The issue was traced back to a simple typo in the Image URL Scheme. The problem was fixed by ensuring the URLs used the correct `https://` scheme before passing them into the Image Loader. The library was then replaced with [Landscapist-Coil3](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist) for Kotlin Multiplatform compatibility and better Lifecycle Handling...

---

### b] Implementing a Search Bar on Top of a Staggered Grid

**Challenge:**
Placing a `SearchBar` above a `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` while maintaining smooth scrolling and preserving state...

**Solution:**
A `Column` layout was introduced, placing the `SearchBar` at the top and the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` beneath it. Proper Padding and Layout Constraints were applied to prevent Content Clipping and Scroll Overlap...

---

### c] Asynchronous Search with Query-Driven API and Room Sync

**Challenge:**
Search functionality needed to hit the REST API only when a user submitted a Book Query, and update the local Room DB accordingly—replacing old data...

**Solution:**
An architecture was designed where the `ViewModel` triggered the repository’s `searchBook(query)` method. This, in turn, called a Suspending Function that:
1. Deleted previous Room entries...
2. Made a fresh API call...
3. Inserted the new results into Room...
   The UI then updated through Flow collection using `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`...

---

### d] Sequential Execution of Suspending Functions

**Challenge:**
Ensuring that Suspending Functions such as `searchBooks()` and `getBooks()` execute in a defined order, especially during a Search operation...

**Solution:**
`withContext(dispatcher)` ensured the code block's Suspend Functions were executed sequentially. The `searchBook()` call was always followed by `getBooks()` within the same coroutine in the `ViewModel`...

---

### e] ViewModel State Not Updating After Search

**Challenge:**
Initial attempts to call `searchBooks()` without subsequently updating the UI resulted in stale data being shown...

**Solution:**
The solution was to call `getBooks()` after `searchBooks()` in the `ViewModel`, ensuring the State Flow was refreshed after new data was written to Room...
