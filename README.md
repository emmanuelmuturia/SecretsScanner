## 5] Challenges and Solutions

While the project highlights modern practices in Secure UI Design, SDLC-aligned Architecture, and Secrets Detection Simulation, several development challenges emerged:

---

### a] Visualizing The Scan Process Across Two States [Pre and Post]

**Challenge:**
The Mobile App was meant to simulate a "Scan" process â€” one screen showing a `Pre-Scan` state, and another screen reflecting the `Post-Scan` result, while maintaining visual consistency and clear feedback cues...

**Solution:**
The Screens were designed with Jetpack Compose using a `Sealed Class` to represent UI States: `Success` and `Error`. Transitions between them were animated using `AnimatedVisibility` and `delay()` to simulate the scan. For a better User Experience [UX], relevant Icons, Status Text, and Background Colour were used to reflect changes between UI States...

---

### b] Designing for Light Mode and Dark Mode

**Challenge:**
Ensuring that both Light Mode and Dark Mode versions of the Mobile App remained visually coherent, with readable content and consistent Design Patterns, was difficult. Colors that worked in Light Mode did not always provide good contrast in Dark Mode, and vice versa...

**Solution:**
Two themes were created and leveraged Material 3â€™s Dynamic Theming. Icons and Text Colours were adjusted using Conditional Styling based on the current System Theme, improving overall Readability and Visual Clarity in both modes...

---

### c] Embedding Screenshots for Dual-Theme Documentation

**Challenge:**
Both Light Mode and Dark Mode screenshots were to be presented for each Screen [Splash, Pre-Scan, and Post-Scan] in a clean and understandable layout for Documentation purposes...

**Solution:**
A two-column, three-row HTML Table was built with aligned Titles and embedded Screenshots using `<img>` Tags and Inline Styling. This showcased both User Interface [UI] Themes side by side, aiding Project Presentation and enhancing Documentation Clarity for viewers reading through the GitHub README...
